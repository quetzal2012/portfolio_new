Portfolio_New

Programming portfolio that didn't work out as planned, 10/14/16

By Adam Baker

Description

This is not how the portfolio was supposed to turn out.  I kept pushing and committing to github, but the changes weren't appearing.  I finally just saved the files from the copy I had in the browser and now the borders and coloring aren't appearing correctly - this just happened at about 4PM, so I have no time to search through it for the problems, but I really just can't understand why it doesn't look like the original did or why the files I were saving went back to a really old version I did in the day,

Known Bugs

I have no idea what went wrong or why it is not appearing like it should.  I can even refresh the old copy in my browser and it works fine.
